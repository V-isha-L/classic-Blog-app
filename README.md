## 📝 About This Project

This blog application was one of my earliest full-stack projects, built back in **October 2024** when I had just begun exploring backend development. I created it using **Express.js**, **EJS templates**, and **vanilla CSS**.

At the time, I hadn't learned Git or GitHub, so it remained local — unseen and unshared. Now, with better tools and understanding, I'm uploading it here as a reminder of where I started and how far I’ve come.

The app supports:
- Creating, editing, and deleting blog posts
- A clean and responsive interface
- A simple backend API to handle post data

> _"Every line of code here carries the excitement of my learning phase — raw, honest, and filled with curiosity."_
